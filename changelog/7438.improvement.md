Simplify our training by overwriting `train_step` instead of `fit` for our custom models.

This allows us to use the build-in callbacks from Keras, such as the 
[Tensorboard Callback](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/callbacks/TensorBoard), 
which offers more functionality compared to what we had before. 

  :::caution
  This change is model breaking. Please, retrain your models.
  
  :::warning
  If you want to use Tensorboard for `DIETClassifier`, `ResponseSelector`, or `TEDPolicy` and log metrics after 
  every (mini)batch, please use 'batch' instead of 'minibatch' as 'tensorboard_log_level'.
