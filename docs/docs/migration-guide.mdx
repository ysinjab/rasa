  Information about changes between major versions of chatbot framework Rasa Core
  and how you can migrate from one version to another.
---

This page contains information about changes between major versions and
how you can migrate from one version to another.

## Rasa 2.1 to Rasa 2.2

### Deprecations

Training and test data in Markdown format is now deprecated. This includes:
- reading and writing of story files in Markdown format
- reading and writing of NLU data in Markdown format
- reading and writing of retrieval intent data in Markdown format

Support for Markdown data will be removed entirely in Rasa Open Source 3.0.0.

Please convert your existing Markdown data by using the commands
described [here](./migration-guide.mdx#training-data-files).

## Rasa 2.0 to Rasa 2.1

### Deprecations

`ConveRTTokenizer` is now deprecated. [ConveRTFeaturizer](./components.mdx#convertfeaturizer) now implements
its behaviour. To migrate, replace `ConveRTTokenizer` with any other tokenizer, for e.g.:

```yaml
pipeline:
    - name: WhitespaceTokenizer
    - name: ConveRTFeaturizer
      model_url: <Remote/Local path to model files>
    ...
```

`HFTransformersNLP` and `LanguageModelTokenizer` components are now deprecated.
[LanguageModelFeaturizer](./components.mdx#languagemodelfeaturizer) now implements their behaviour.
To migrate, replace both the above components with any tokenizer and specify the model architecture and model weights
as part of `LanguageModelFeaturizer`, for e.g.:

```yaml
pipeline:
    - name: WhitespaceTokenizer
    - name: LanguageModelFeaturizer
      model_name: "bert"
      model_weights: "rasa/LaBSE"
    ...
```

## Rasa 1.10 to Rasa 2.0

### General

A lot has changed in version 2.0. Make sure you read
through this guide thoroughly, to make sure all parts of your bot are updated.
A lot of updates can be done automatically with inbuilt commands, others will need
some manual conversion. If you have any feedback about these updates or the migration process, please post it
in the [forum](https://forum.rasa.com/t/rasa-open-source-2-0-is-out-now-internal-draft/35577).

### Training data files

As of version 2.0, the new default training data format is yaml. Markdown is still supported,
but this will be deprecated in Rasa Open Source 3.0.0.

You can convert existing NLU, Stories, and NLG (i.e. `responses.md`) training data
files in the Markdown format to the new YAML format using following commands:

```bash
rasa data convert nlu -f yaml --data={SOURCE_DIR} --out={TARGET_DIR}
rasa data convert nlg -f yaml --data={SOURCE_DIR} --out={TARGET_DIR}
rasa data convert core -f yaml --data={SOURCE_DIR} --out={TARGET_DIR}
```

Converted files will have the same names as the original ones but with a
`_converted.yml` suffix.

If you are using [forms](./migration-guide.mdx#forms) or [response selectors](./migration-guide.mdx#response-selectors),
some additional changes will need to be made as described in their respective sections.

### Policies

With the introduction of [rules](./rules.mdx) and the [RulePolicy](./policies.mdx#rule-policy),
the following policies are deprecated:

- [Mapping Policy](./policies.mdx#mapping-policy)
- [Fallback Policy](./policies.mdx#fallback-policy)
- [Two-Stage-Fallback Policy](./policies.mdx#two-stage-fallback-policy)
- [Form Policy](./policies.mdx#form-policy)


To migrate the policies automatically, you can run the following command:

```bash
rasa data convert config
```

This command will take care of updating your `config.yml` and `domain.yml`, while
making backups of your existing files using the `.bak` suffix. It will also add a
`rules.yml` if necessary.

Your forms will still function as normal in the old format after this update, but this command
does not convert them into the new format automatically. This should be done manually, as
described in the section on [forms](./migration-guide.mdx#forms).

You can also migrate the individual policies manually, if you don't want to use the automatic conversion command.

#### Manually migrating from the Mapping Policy

If you previously used the [Mapping Policy](./policies.mdx#mapping-policy), you
can follow the documentation on [FAQs](./chitchat-faqs.mdx) to convert your mapped
intents to rules. Suppose you previously mapped an intent `ask_is_bot` as follows:

```yaml-rasa title="domain.yml"
intents:
 - ask_is_bot:
     triggers: action_is_bot
```

This becomes the following rule:

```yaml-rasa title="rules.yml"
rules:
- rule: Rule to map `ask_is_bot` intent
  steps:
  - intent: ask_is_bot
  - action: action_is_bot
```

And you can safely remove any `triggers:` from your domain:

```yaml-rasa title="domain.yml"
intents:
 - ask_is_bot
```

Finally, you can replace the Mapping Policy with the
[Rule Policy](./policies.mdx#rule-policy) in your model configuration:

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml"
policies:
  # Other policies
  - name: RulePolicy
```

#### Manually migrating from the Fallback Policy

If you previously used the [Fallback Policy](./policies.mdx#fallback-policy), the following model
configuration would translate as follows given a previous configuration like this:

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml"
policies:
  - name: "FallbackPolicy"
    nlu_threshold: 0.4
    core_threshold: 0.3
    fallback_action_name: "action_default_fallback"
    ambiguity_threshold: 0.1
```

The new configuration would then look like:

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml"
policies:
  # Other policies
  - name: RulePolicy
    core_fallback_threshold: 0.3
    core_fallback_action_name: "action_default_fallback"

pipeline:
  # Other components
  - name: FallbackClassifier
    threshold: 0.4
    ambiguity_threshold: 0.1
```

In addition, you need to add a [rule](./rules.mdx) to specify which action to run
in case of low NLU confidence:

```yaml-rasa title="rules.yml"
rules:
  - rule: Ask the user to rephrase whenever they send a message with low NLU confidence
    steps:
    - intent: nlu_fallback
    - action: utter_please_rephrase
```

See the documentation on [fallback](./fallback-handoff.mdx#fallbacks) for more
information.

#### Manually migrating from the Two-Stage-Fallback Policy

If you previously used the
[Two-Stage-Fallback Policy](./policies.mdx#two-stage-fallback-policy), with a configuration
like this for example:

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml"
policies:
  - name: TwoStageFallbackPolicy
    nlu_threshold: 0.4
    ambiguity_threshold: 0.1
    core_threshold: 0.3
    fallback_core_action_name: "action_default_fallback"
    fallback_nlu_action_name: "action_default_fallback"
    deny_suggestion_intent_name: "out_of_scope"
```

The new configuration would look like this:

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml"
policies:
  # Other policies
  - name: RulePolicy
    core_fallback_threshold: 0.3
    core_fallback_action_name: "action_default_fallback"

pipeline:
  # Other components
  - name: FallbackClassifier
    threshold: 0.4
    ambiguity_threshold: 0.1
```

In addition you need to add a [rule](./rules.mdx) to activate the Two-Stage Fallback for
messages with low NLU confidence.

```yaml-rasa title="rules.yml"
rules:
  - rule: Implementation of the TwoStageFallbackPolicy
    steps:
    # This intent is automatically triggered by the `FallbackClassifier` in the NLU
    # pipeline in case the intent confidence was below the specified threshold.
    - intent: nlu_fallback
    # The Fallback is now implemented as a form.
    - action: action_two_stage_fallback
    - active_loop: action_two_stage_fallback
```

Note that the previous parameters `fallback_nlu_action_name` and
`deny_suggestion_intent_name` are no longer configurable and have the fixed values
`action_default_fallback` and `out_of_scope`.

See the [fallback](./fallback-handoff.mdx#fallbacks) documentation for more
information.

### Forms

As of version 2.0 the logic for [forms](./forms.mdx) has been moved from the
Rasa SDK to Rasa Open Source to simplify implementation and make it easier to write
action servers in other languages.

This means that forms are no longer implemented using a `FormAction`, but instead
defined in the domain. Any customizations around requesting slots or
[slot validation](./forms.mdx#validating-form-input) can be handled with a `FormValidationAction`.

Consider a custom form action from 1.x like this:

```python
from typing import Text, List, Any, Dict, Union
from rasa_sdk import Tracker
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
from rasa_sdk.forms  import FormAction

class RestaurantForm(FormAction):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "restaurant_form"

    @staticmethod
    def required_slots(tracker: Tracker) -> List[Text]:
        return ["cuisine"]

    def slot_mappings(self) -> Dict[Text, Union[Dict, List[Dict]]]:
        return {
            "cuisine": self.from_entity(entity="cuisine", not_intent="chitchat"),
        }

    @staticmethod
    def cuisine_db() -> List[Text]:
        """Database of supported cuisines"""

        return ["caribbean", "chinese", "french"]

    def validate_cuisine(
        self,
        value: Text,
        dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
        tracker: Tracker,
        domain: Dict[Text, Any],
    ) -> Dict[Text, Any]:
        """Validate cuisine value."""

        if value.lower() in self.cuisine_db():
            # validation succeeded, set the value of the "cuisine" slot to value
            return {"cuisine": value}
        else:
            dispatcher.utter_message(template="utter_wrong_cuisine")
            # validation failed, set this slot to None, meaning the
            # user will be asked for the slot again
            return {"cuisine": None}

    def submit(
        self,
        dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
        tracker: Tracker,
        domain: Dict[Text, Any],
    ) -> List[Dict]:
        """Define what the form has to do
            after all required slots are filled"""

        # utter submit template
        dispatcher.utter_message(template="utter_submit")
        return []
```

Start the migration by removing the FormPolicy and adding the [RulePolicy](./policies.mdx#rule-policy)
(if not there already) to your model configuration:

```yaml-rasa title="config.yml"
policies:
  # Other policies
  # ...
  - name: RulePolicy
```

Then you need to define the form, required slots and their slot mappings
in the domain as described in the documentation on [forms](./forms.mdx#defining-a-form):

```yaml-rasa title="domain.yml"
forms:
  restaurant_form:
    cuisine:
    - type: cuisine
      entity: cuisine
      not_intent: chitchat
```
If you ran the command to [convert your stories](./migration-guide.mdx#training-data-Files),
you will have a story that handles form activation and deactivation like this:

```yaml-rasa title="stories.yml"
stories:
  - story: cuisine form
    steps:
    - intent: request_restaurant
    - action: restaurant_form
    - active_loop: restaurant_form
    - active_loop: null
    - action: utter_submit
```

This will work fine, but the best way to handle form behavior is to remove this story and instead
define two separate rules for form activation and submission:

```yaml-rasa title="rules.yml"
rules:
  - rule: Activate form
    steps:
    - intent: request_restaurant
    - action: restaurant_form
    - active_loop: restaurant_form

  - rule: Submit form
    condition:
    # Condition that form is active.
    - active_loop: restaurant_form
    steps:
    - action: restaurant_form
    - active_loop: null
    # The action we want to run when the form is submitted.
    - action: utter_submit
```

The last step is to implement a custom action to validate the form slots. Start by
adding the custom action to your domain:

```yaml-rasa title="domain.yml"
actions:
  # Other actions
  # ...
  - validate_restaurant_form
```

Then add a custom action which validates the `cuisine` slot:

```python
from typing import Text, List, Any, Dict, Union
from rasa_sdk import Tracker
from rasa_sdk.executor import CollectingDispatcher
from rasa_sdk import FormValidationAction
from rasa_sdk.types import DomainDict

class RestaurantFormValidator(FormValidationAction):
    def name(self) -> Text:
        return "validate_restaurant_form"

    @staticmethod
    def cuisine_db() -> List[Text]:
        """Database of supported cuisines"""

        return ["caribbean", "chinese", "french"]

    def validate_cuisine(
        self,
        slot_value: Any,
        dispatcher: CollectingDispatcher,
        tracker: Tracker,
        domain: DomainDict,
    ) -> Dict[Text, Any]:
        """Validate cuisine value."""

        if slot_value.lower() in self.cuisine_db():
            # validation succeeded, set the value of the "cuisine" slot to value
            return {"cuisine": slot_value}
        else:
            # validation failed, set this slot to None, meaning the
            # user will be asked for the slot again
            return {"cuisine": None}
```

You can also migrate forms from Rasa SDK to Rasa Open Source 2 iteratively. You can for
example migrate one form to the Rasa Open Source 2 implementation while continue using
the deprecated Rasa SDK implementation for another form. To continue to use
the deprecated Rasa SDK `FormAction`s, add a custom action with the name of your form to your domain. Note that you should complete the migration as soon as possible as the deprecated `FormAction`
will be removed from the Rasa SDK in Rasa Open Source 3.

```yaml-rasa title="domain.yml"
actions:
# Adding a custom action for a form will
# instruct Rasa Open Source to use the
# deprecated Rasa SDK implementation of forms.
- my_form

forms:
 my_form:
```

See the [forms](./forms.mdx) documentation for more details.

### Response Selectors

Response Selectors are a stable feature as of version 2.0.

The [conversion command](./migration-guide.mdx#training-data-files) will automatically
convert your `responses.md` file, stories and nlu training data to the new yaml format.
It will also take care of adding the `utter_` prefix to your responses.
Additionally you will need to rename the `respond_` actions in your stories files to use the
`utter_` prefix instead. Run the following command to apply these changes:

```bash
rasa data convert responses --data {SOURCE_DIR} --out={TARGET_DIR}
```

You can also apply these changes manually. For example:

```yaml-rasa
stories:
  - story: chitchat
    steps:
    - intent: chitchat
    - action: respond_chitchat
```
becomes

```yaml-rasa
stories:
  - story: chitchat
    steps:
    - intent: chitchat
    - action: utter_chitchat
```

and you will need to add the `utter_` prefix to the response names in your `responses.md`
as well. For example:

```yaml-rasa
responses:
  chitchat/ask_name:
    - text: Oh yeah, I am called the retrieval bot.

  chitchat/ask_weather:
    - text: Oh, it does look sunny right now in Berlin.
```

becomes

```yaml-rasa
responses:
  utter_chitchat/ask_name:
    - text: Oh yeah, I am called the retrieval bot.

  utter_chitchat/ask_weather:
    - text: Oh, it does look sunny right now in Berlin.
```

Finally, you should remove any actions with the `respond_` prefix from the actions
list in your domain.

This behavior will work fine when defined as a story, but even better when defined
as a rule. You should consider transferring your retrieval stories to rules. More information
on what that looks like in the [chitchat and FAQs documentation](./chitchat-faqs.mdx).


Response Selectors are now trained on retrieval intent labels by default instead
of the actual response text. For most models, this should improve training time
and accuracy of the `ResponseSelector`.

If you want to revert to the pre-2.0 default behavior, add the `use_text_as_label: true`
parameter to your `ResponseSelector` component:

```yaml-rasa
pipeline:
  # other components
  - name: ResponseSelector
    use_text_as_label: true
```

The output schema of `ResponseSelector` has changed. An example output looks like this:

```json {3-4,10,11,20}
{
  "response_selector": {
    "all_retrieval_intents": [
      "faq"
    ],
    "default": {
      "response": {
        "id": 1388783286124362000,
        "confidence": 1,
        "intent_response_key": "faq/is_legit",
        "response_templates": [
          {
            "text": "absolutely",
            "image": "https://i.imgur.com/nGF1K8f.jpg"
          },
          {
            "text": "I think so."
          }
        ]
        "template_name": "utter_faq/is_legit"
      },
      "ranking": [
        {
          "id": 1388783286124362000,
          "confidence": 1,
          "intent_response_key": "faq/is_legit"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
As a result of this, if you were previously querying for the key `full_retrieval_intent` as:
```python {2}
response_selector_output.get("default")
                        .get("full_retrieval_intent")
```
you should instead now do this:
```python {2-3}
response_selector_output.get("default")
                        .get("response")
                        .get("intent_response_key")
```


### Unfeaturized Slots

[Slots](domain.mdx#slots) of type [unfeaturized](domain.mdx#unfeaturized-slot) are
deprecated and will be removed in version 3.0. To ignore slot values during
a conversation, set the `influence_conversation` property of the slot to `false`.

The following snippet is an example of the deprecated unfeaturized slot usage:

```yaml-rasa
slots:
  username:
    type: unfeaturized
```

To update this to the new format, you can specify the expected data type `text` and
define that the slot should be ignored during the conversation.

```yaml-rasa
slots:
  username:
    type: text
    # Set `influence_conversation` to `false`
    # to ignore the slot value during the conversation.
    influence_conversation: false
```

If you don't require the slot to have a specific data type, you can use the new slot
type [any](domain.mdx#any-slot). This slot type is always ignored during a conversation
and does not make any assumptions regarding the data type of the slot value.

```yaml-rasa
slots:
  username:
    type: any
```

Please see the updated [slots documentation](domain.mdx#slots) for more information.

### Conversation sessions

[Conversation sessions](domain.mdx#session-configuration) are now enabled by default
if your [Domain](domain.mdx) does not contain a session configuration. Previously a
missing session configuration was treated as if conversation sessions were disabled.
You can explicitly disable conversation sessions using the following snippet:

```yaml-rasa title="domain.yml"
session_config:
  # A session expiration time of `0`
  # disables conversation sessions
  session_expiration_time: 0
```


### Dialogue Featurization

This section is only relevant if you explicitly defined [featurizers](./policies.mdx#featurizers)
in your policy configuration.

LabelTokenizerSingleStateFeaturizer is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
It should be replaced with SingleStateFeaturizer and some changes should be made to the NLU pipeline.
Add a `Tokenizer` with the option `intent_tokenization_flag: True` and `CountVectorsFeaturizer`
to the NLU pipeline.

For example:
```yaml-rasa {3-5}
language: en
pipeline:
  - name: WhitespaceTokenizer
    intent_tokenization_flag: True
  - name: CountVectorsFeaturizer
  # other components
policies:
  # other policies
  - name: TEDPolicy
    featurizer:
    - name: SingleStateFeaturizer

```

BinarySingleStateFeaturizer is deprecated and will be removed in the future.
You should replace it with `SingleStateFeaturizer` and a NLU pipeline
where `intent_tokenization_flag` of a Tokenizer is set to `False`.

For example:
```yaml-rasa {4}
language: en
pipeline:
  - name: WhitespaceTokenizer
    intent_tokenization_flag: False
  # other components
policies:
  # other policies
  - name: TEDPolicy
    featurizer:
    - name: SingleStateFeaturizer

```

### Deprecations

The deprecated [event brokers](./event-brokers.mdx) FileProducer, KafkaProducer, PikaProducer
and SQLProducer have been removed. If you used these brokers in your
`endpoints.yml` make sure to use the renamed variants instead:
  - FileProducer became FileEventBroker
  - KafkaProducer became KafkaEventBroker
  - PikaProducer became PikaEventBroker
  - SQLProducer became  SQLEventBroker

The deprecated EmbeddingIntentClassifier has been removed. If you used this
component in your pipeline configuration (`config.yml`) you can replace it
with [DIETClassifier](./components.mdx#dietclassifier).
It accepts the same configuration parameters.

The deprecated KerasPolicy has been removed. If you used this
component in your policies configuration (`config.yml`) you can replace it
with [TEDPolicy](./policies.mdx#ted-policy). It accepts the same configuration parameters.

## Rasa 1.7 to Rasa 1.8

:::caution
This is a release **breaking backwards compatibility**.
It is not possible to load previously trained models. Please make sure to retrain a
model before trying to use it with this improved version.

:::

### General

* The [TED Policy](./policies.mdx#ted-policy) replaced the `keras_policy` as recommended machine
  learning policy. New projects generated with `rasa init` will automatically use
  this policy. In case you want to change your existing model configuration to use the
  [TED Policy](./policies.mdx#ted-policy) add this to the `policies` section in your `config.yml`
  and remove potentially existing `KerasPolicy` entries:

  ```yaml-rasa
  policies:
  # - ... other policies
  - name: TEDPolicy
    max_history: 5
    epochs: 100
  ```

  The given snippet specifies default values for the parameters `max_history` and
  `epochs`. `max_history` is particularly important and strongly depends on your stories.
  Please see the docs of the [TED Policy](./policies.mdx#ted-policy) if you want to customize them.

* All pre-defined pipeline templates are deprecated. **Any templates you use will be
  mapped to the new configuration, but the underlying architecture is the same**.
  Take a look at [Tuning Your Model](./tuning-your-model.mdx) to decide on what components you should use
  in your configuration file.

* The Embedding Policy was renamed to [TED Policy](./policies.mdx#ted-policy). The functionality of the policy stayed the same.
  Please update your configuration files to use `TEDPolicy` instead of `EmbeddingPolicy`.

* Most of the model options for `EmbeddingPolicy`, `EmbeddingIntentClassifier`, and `ResponseSelector` got
  renamed. Please update your configuration files using the following mapping:

  |      Old model option       |                  New model option                   |

  Old configuration options will be mapped to the new names, and a warning will be thrown.
  However, these will be deprecated in a future release.

* The Embedding Intent Classifier is now deprecated and will be replaced by [DIETClassifier](./components.mdx#dietclassifier)
  in the future.
  `DIETClassfier` performs intent classification as well as entity recognition.
  If you want to get the same model behavior as the current `EmbeddingIntentClassifier`, you can use
  the following configuration of `DIETClassifier`:

  ```yaml-rasa
  pipeline:
  # - ... other components
  - name: DIETClassifier
    hidden_layers_sizes:
      text: [256, 128]
    number_of_transformer_layers: 0
    weight_sparsity: 0
    intent_classification: True
    entity_recognition: False
    use_masked_language_model: False
    BILOU_flag: False
    # ... any other parameters
  ```

  See [DIETClassifier](./components.mdx#dietclassifier) for more information about the new component.
  Specifying `EmbeddingIntentClassifier` in the configuration maps to the above component definition, the
  behavior is unchanged from previous versions.

* `CRFEntityExtractor` is now deprecated and will be replaced by `DIETClassifier` in the future. If you want to
  get the same model behavior as the current `CRFEntityExtractor`, you can use the following configuration:

  ```yaml-rasa
  pipeline:
  # - ... other components
  - name: LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer
    features: [
      ["low", "title", "upper"],
      [
        "BOS",
        "EOS",
        "low",
        "prefix5",
        "prefix2",
        "suffix5",
        "suffix3",
        "suffix2",
        "upper",
        "title",
        "digit",
      ],
      ["low", "title", "upper"],
    ]
  - name: DIETClassifier
    intent_classification: False
    entity_recognition: True
    use_masked_language_model: False
    number_of_transformer_layers: 0
    # ... any other parameters
  ```

  `CRFEntityExtractor` featurizes user messages on its own, it does not depend on any featurizer.
  We extracted the featurization from the component into the new featurizer [LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer](./components.mdx#lexicalsyntacticfeaturizer). Thus,
  in order to obtain the same results as before, you need to add this featurizer to your pipeline before the
  [DIETClassifier](./components.mdx#dietclassifier).
  Specifying `CRFEntityExtractor` in the configuration maps to the above component definition, the behavior
  is unchanged from previous versions.

* If your pipeline contains `CRFEntityExtractor` and `EmbeddingIntentClassifier` you can substitute both
  components with [DIETClassifier](./components.mdx#dietclassifier). You can use the following pipeline for that:

  ```yaml-rasa
  pipeline:
  # - ... other components
  - name: LexicalSyntacticFeaturizer
    features: [
      ["low", "title", "upper"],
      [
        "BOS",
        "EOS",
        "low",
        "prefix5",
        "prefix2",
        "suffix5",
        "suffix3",
        "suffix2",
        "upper",
        "title",
        "digit",
      ],
      ["low", "title", "upper"],
    ]
  - name: DIETClassifier
    number_of_transformer_layers: 0
    # ... any other parameters
  ```

## Rasa 1.6 to Rasa 1.7

### General

* By default, the `EmbeddingIntentClassifier`, `EmbeddingPolicy`, and `ResponseSelector` will
  now normalize the top 10 confidence results if the `loss_type` is `"softmax"` (which has been
  default since 1.3, see [Rasa 1.2 to Rasa 1.3](./migration-guide.mdx#rasa-12-to-rasa-13)). This is configurable via the `ranking_length`
  configuration parameter; to turn off normalization to match the previous behavior, set `ranking_length: 0`.

## Rasa 1.2 to Rasa 1.3

:::caution
This is a release **breaking backwards compatibility**.
It is not possible to load previously trained models. Please make sure to retrain a
model before trying to use it with this improved version.

:::

### General

* Default parameters of `EmbeddingIntentClassifier` are changed. See
  the Components page for details.
  Architecture implementation is changed as well, so **old trained models cannot be loaded**.
  Default parameters and architecture for `EmbeddingPolicy` are changed. See [Policies](./policies.mdx) for details.
  It uses transformer instead of lstm. **Old trained models cannot be loaded**.
  They use `inner` similarity and `softmax` loss by default instead of
  `cosine` similarity and `margin` loss (can be set in config file).
  They use `balanced` batching strategy by default to counteract class imbalance problem.
  The meaning of `evaluate_on_num_examples` is changed. If it is non zero, random examples will be
  picked by stratified split and used as **hold out** validation set, so they will be excluded from training data.
  We suggest to set it to zero (default) if data set contains a lot of unique examples of dialogue turns.
  Removed `label_tokenization_flag` and `label_split_symbol` from component. Instead moved intent splitting to `Tokenizer` components via `intent_tokenization_flag` and `intent_split_symbol` flag.

* Default `max_history` for `EmbeddingPolicy` is `None` which means it'll use
  the `FullDialogueTrackerFeaturizer`. We recommend to set `max_history` to
  some finite value in order to use `MaxHistoryTrackerFeaturizer`
  for **faster training**. See [Featurizers](./policies.mdx#featurizers) for details.
  We recommend to increase `batch_size` for `MaxHistoryTrackerFeaturizer`
  (e.g. `"batch_size": [32, 64]`)

* **Compare** mode of `rasa train core` allows the whole core config comparison.
  Therefore, we changed the naming of trained models. They are named by config file
  name instead of policy name. Old naming style will not be read correctly when
  creating **compare** plots (`rasa test core`). Please remove old trained models
  in comparison folder and retrain. Normal core training is unaffected.

* We updated the **evaluation metric** for our **NER**. We report the weighted precision and f1-score.
  So far we included `no-entity` in this report. However, as most of the tokens actually don't have
  an entity set, this will influence the weighted precision and f1-score quite a bit. From now on we
  exclude `no-entity` from the evaluation. The overall metrics now only include proper entities. You
  might see a drop in the performance scores when running the evaluation again.

* `/` is reserved as a delimiter token to distinguish between retrieval intent and the corresponding response text
  identifier. Make sure you don't include `/` symbol in the name of your intents.


## Rasa NLU 0.14.x and Rasa Core 0.13.x to Rasa 1.0

:::caution
This is a release **breaking backwards compatibility**.
It is not possible to load previously trained models. Please make sure to retrain a
model before trying to use it with this improved version.

:::

### General

* The scripts in `rasa.core` and `rasa.nlu` can no longer be executed. To train, test, run, … an NLU or Core
  model, you should now use the command line interface `rasa`. The functionality is, for the most part, the same as before.
  Some changes in commands reflect the combined training and running of NLU and Core models, but NLU and Core can still
  be trained and used individually. If you attempt to run one of the old scripts in `rasa.core` or `rasa.nlu`,
  an error is thrown that points you to the command you
  should use instead. See all the new commands at [Command Line Interface](./command-line-interface.mdx).

* If you have written a custom output channel, all `send_` methods subclassed
  from the `OutputChannel` class need to take an additional `\*\*kwargs`
  argument. You can use these keyword args from your custom action code or the
  templates in your domain file to send any extra parameters used in your
  channel's send methods.

* If you were previously importing the `Button` or `Element` classes from
  `rasa_core.dispatcher`, these are now to be imported from `rasa_sdk.utils`.

* Rasa NLU and Core previously used <a href="https://legacy-docs.rasa.com/docs/nlu/0.15.1/migrations/?&_ga=2.218966814.608734414.1560704810-314462423.1543594887#id1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">separate configuration files</a>.
  These two files should be merged into a single file either named `config.yml`, or passed via the `--config` parameter.

### Script parameters

* All script parameter names have been unified to follow the same schema.
  Any underscores (`_`) in arguments have been replaced with dashes (`-`).
  For example: `--max_history` has been changed to `--max-history`. You can
  see all of the script parameters in the `--help` output of the commands
  in the [Command Line Interface](./command-line-interface.mdx).

* The `--num_threads` parameter was removed from the `run` command. The
  server will always run single-threaded, but will now run asynchronously. If you want to
  make use of multiple processes, feel free to check out the [Sanic server
  documentation](https://sanic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sanic/deploying.html#running-via-gunicorn).

* To avoid conflicts in script parameter names, connectors in the `run` command now need to be specified with
  `--connector`, as `-c` is no longer supported. The maximum history in the `rasa visualize` command needs to be
  defined with `--max-history`. Output paths and log files cannot be specified with `-o` anymore; `--out` and
  `--log-file` should be used. NLU data has been standarized to be `--nlu` and the name of
  any kind of data files or directory to be `--data`.

### HTTP API

* There are numerous HTTP API endpoint changes which can be found [here](./http-api.mdx).
